in this Capstone i have received new offer to work in a company far away from my current location or city, 
I love My neighborhood mainly because of all the great amenities and other types of venues that exist in the neighborhood, 
so i have to study all the neighbors for the new locations to decide which the better place for me to live. 
i will segment location data for the new city into different neighborhoods using the geographical coordinates of the center of each neighborhood. 
And then, using a combination of location data and machine learning, I will group the neighborhoods into clusters so i can choose the best one fit my needs.
